podcast_description: |
  In episode 26, we interviewed Bhavani Ravi about the Python data analysis library pandas. After a brief introduction about her use of machine leaning models for pharmaceutical research, we talked extensively about pandas. She told us how much pandas is important for her everyday tasks and the strict quality standards of the project. We talked about the features provided by pandas and its compatibility with other Python libraries. We then discussed the importance of FLOSS in her industry and how they are contributing back to important projects. She share with us her experience as a first time contributor to pandas and how to find good first time issues for newcomers. We finished the interview with out usual quick questions.

# About Pandas:

pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

pandas is a NumFOCUS sponsored project. This will help ensure the success of development of pandas as a world-class open-source project, and makes it possible to donate to the project.

# About Bhavani Ravi:

Bhavani Ravi is a Research Engineer at  Saama Technologies working on deploying clean, scalable and quality machine learning models to production systems. Even though her career is enough to keep her busy, she likes to pay forward all the motivation and support she received by running WomenTechMakers chennai community, where she enables a forum for talented women to explore the male-dominated tech world. Outside of development and communities, she is a blogger, bibliophile, wannapreneur, and constant learner. You can find more about her at bhavaniravi.com
